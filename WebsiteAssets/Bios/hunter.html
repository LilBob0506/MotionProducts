                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Hunter Reinhart, a senior at the University of Alabama, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus in cybersecurity, with a graduation date of Spring 2025. I am a
                    Tuscaloosa, Alabama local. My academic interests include software development, and security. I am passionate about solving unique problems and finding the pieces of the puzzle to solve these
                    problems. After graduation, I aim to pursue a career in software development. Ideally I would like to work on the evolution of AI or in game design, but as long as there is a complex problem to
                    solve I will be content with my work.</p>
